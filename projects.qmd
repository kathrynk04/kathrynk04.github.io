<h1>Pickleweed Project</h1>

<p>

Since fall quarter of my 2nd year in college, I've been working on a research project with the DECOMP Lab in the Department of Geography here at UCSB. I initially joined the project as a research assistant for Germ치n Silva, who started the pickleweed project to determine how changes in soil salinity impact the anthocyanin concentration of pickleweed, which is a plant that is native to wetlands in California. About a year into the project, I was offered the chance to start my own project related to Germ치n's, so I decided to study how changes in soil salinity impact the chlorophyll content of pickleweed.

Germ치n and I got to collect pickleweed seeds in UCSB's North Campus Open Space, and then we planted them in pans and then repotted them in individual pots after they germinated. We had a little bit over 180 pickleweed plants, each in their own pot, which we kept in one of UCSB's greenhouses. For a while after being repotted, we watered them with deionized water. Once they got adjusted to their new pots and had grown some more, we started watering them with three different salinity treatments: a control, low, and high.

We let the pickleweed grow in the greenhouse for about a year and then harvested all of them and extracted the chlorophyll from each. To determine the chlorophyll content, we put the extracts in a spectrophotometer, which read the absorbance of the extracts at three different wavelengths. Using the absorbance values, we could then calculate the chlorophyll concentration.

Through this project, I've gotten to learn a lot about the research process and build many skills. I've written grant proposals, presented my poster at a conference and multiple research symposiums, and I've also started learning how to code in RStudio so that I could analyze my data more efficiently. Futhermore, being part of the lab for so long has given me the opportunity to form close relationships with my PI, Jennifer King, my graduate advisor, Germ치n Silva, and the other lab members. I'm so glad that I decided to apply for the research assistant position two years ago because it has been an amazing professional development opportunity that has shaped my UCSB experience, and I've also formed so many fun memories with my lab mates that I'll always cherish.
