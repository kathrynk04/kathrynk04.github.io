    "text": "Classes\n\n\nThis summer, I’ll be staying in Isla Vista and continuing to take classes. I’ve always liked taking classes during the summer because lots of my friends also stay for the summer and I like to still be productive during breaks. Also, I need to get lots of units as a double major, so I have to take summer classes to graduate within four years. This summer, I’ll be taking Aquatic Food Management, Conservation Planning, Green Building, and Introduction to Geographic Information Systems and Science.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nScuba\n\n\nBesides classes, I will also be taking the Open Water Scuba Certification course offered by UCSB’s Recreation Center. The course is only 3.5 hours twice a week for three weeks, followed by an 11 hour boat dive and then a five hour beach dive the next day. It is a quite expensive course and I will also have to buy some of my own gear, but I’ve heard that getting scuba certified through the Recreation Center is cheaper than getting it from most other places. Additionally, I’m really excited to have a new outdoor hobby and hopefully get to explore cool diving spots around the world!\n\n\n\nTrips\n\n\nMy last plan for the summer is that I’m potentially going on a trip to Japan with my partner. I’ve been wanting to learn how to ski for a while, but going skiing and especially getting skiing lessons is a lot more expensive in the United States than it is in Japan. Therefore, this trip will be another chance for me to gain a new outdoor hobby. My partner and I also both really love Japanese food, so we’re excited to get to eat lots of ramen, sushi, curry, and more.\nI don’t currently have any camping trips planned for this summer, but my camping trips are usually pretty spontaneous, so I will hopefully make some plans during the summer. I’ve recently been looking for camping gear on Facebook Marketplace, so once I have all the gear I need, I’m going to plan a trip as soon as possible!"

    "text": "This code was written for the midterm for ENVS 193DS, which is Statistics for Environmental Science. In the first section, I read in all of the packages that I needed for the entire midterm assignment, but not all of the packages will be used in this section because this was only part of the assignment. I also read in the csv file “200dailys.csv” and stored it as an object called “rain”. This file shows the monthly rainfall recorded by a UCSB rain gauge on top of Ellison Hall.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) # loading in packages\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(lterdatasampler)\nlibrary(rstatix)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(flextable)\n\nrain &lt;- read_csv(\"200dailys.csv\") # reading in and storing problem 4 data as an object called \"rain\"\n\n\nIn the next section, the code wasn’t written by me because our instructions were to write in the annotations what each line of code is doing. You can therefore read the annotations to understand the code.\n\n\nrain &lt;- read_csv(\"200dailys.csv\")\nrain_clean &lt;- rain |&gt;  \n  \n  # 1. what changes after this function? \n  # Column names are cleaned to replace spaces with underscores, add numbers to duplicated names, and converts characters such as \"%\" and \"#\" to \"percent\" and \"number\", respectively.\n  # give an example. \n  # \"average tussock cm\" would be changed to \"average_tussock_cm\".\n  clean_names() |&gt;  \n  \n  # 2. what new column is created? \n  # A column named \"water_year_minus1\".\n  # give an example of a value in this column.\n  # 1951\n  mutate(water_year_minus1 = water_year - 1) |&gt;  \n  \n  # 3. what old column is changed?\n  # water_year.\n  # give an example of a value in the old column, and explain how it changed. \n  # A value in the old column was 1952 and it would become 1951-1952. It was changed by pasting first the year minus 1 (1951) followed by a \"-\" symbol and then the year (1952).\n  mutate(water_year = paste0(water_year_minus1, \"-\", water_year)) |&gt; \n  \n  # 4. what columns are excluded from the data frame?\n  # \"water_year_minus1\" and \"code\" are excluded.\n  # give an example of a value in water_year_minus1 \n  # 1951\n  # give an example of a value in code \n  # E311\n  select(!c(water_year_minus1, code)) |&gt; \n  \n  # 5. which column is manipulated, and what changes about it? \n  # Hint: run str(rain_clean) in the Console. what do you see for the month column?\n  # The month column is manipulated. The month numbers are turned into factors and the levels of the factors are set with \"9\" as the first level, \"10\" as the second, and so on until \"12\" is the fourth and then it loops back around to \"1\" being the fifth and continues.\n  mutate(month = as_factor(month),\n         month = fct_relevel(\n           month, \n           \"9\", \"10\", \"11\", \"12\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\")\n         ) |&gt;  \n  \n  # 6. what is being calculated? on an annual, monthly, or daily scale? \n  # Total rainfall in inches is being calculated on an annual scale.\n  # give an example. \n  # There was one rain event in September which was 0.01 inches, and one rain event in October which was 0.30 inches. The sum() function would add these two numbers (0.01 + 0.30 = 0.31) and then move on to the next daily_rain cell to continue adding to this value.\n  group_by(month, water_year) %&gt;% \n  summarize(total_rain = sum(daily_rain, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;  \n  ungroup() |&gt;  \n  \n  # 7. what is being done to which columns? \n  # missing combinations of values of water_year and month are being filled in with 0\n  # give an example. \n  # july in 1951-1952 was not in the data frame previously, and now is present with a total rain of 0 inches\n  complete(water_year, \n           month, \n           fill = list(total_rain = 0)) |&gt;  \n  \n  # 8. which observations are kept after this filtering step?\n  # Data for the years listed below are kept.\n  filter(water_year %in% c(\"2018-2019\", \n                           \"2019-2020\", \n                           \"2020-2021\", \n                           \"2021-2022\", \n                           \"2022-2023\", \n                           \"2023-2024\"))\n\n\nThe last part of the assignment was to write the code to create a figure that looks exactly like the one below, which visualizes the data I stored as an object in the first code chunk. We had to write all of the code for this section from scratch in order to prove that we could apply what we learned in class towards making figures ourselves.

    "text": "Growing Up\n\n\nI grew up in a suburb north of Dallas, Texas, called Frisco, which is where I lived from the time I was born until I moved to study at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I lived with my two parents, and we adopted a little Chihuahua mix named Marty when I was in first grade, and a little Boston Terrier mix named Bunny when I was in sixth grade.\nIn middle school, I joined my school’s band and played the trumpet. Through band, I met everyone who would become my closest friends throughout the years, as we spent a lot of time with each other each year in band class. In High School, it was required that everyone in band was also in the marching band, so we got to attend every football game in the fall and also participate in competitions against other marching bands in October. My school had a really band program, so we would usually do pretty well in competitions. Every other year, bands could compete to go to the State marching competition, and my band made it both years we got to compete while I was there. We placed eighth in the state my second year, and were in the top twenty my senior year. Band and especially marching band were both really big commitments that took up a lot of my time and energy, but what kept me going through the years was my friends and all of the amazing memories I got to make with them along the way.\nDuring my freshman year of high school, I started running in my free time. But, it wasn’t until my junior year of high school that I decided to join the cross country team halfway through the season. While band often had challenging moments, cross country was even more difficult because at each meet, we had to race a 5k against lots of other girls, which feels like a really long time to run and ends up being pretty painful, if you push yourself. Not only was it physically challenging, it was also always mentally challenging to fight off the urge to start walking whenever I was feeling especially tired or I had gotten a cramp. However, I loved my teammates and, like my band friends, they motivated me to keep showing up to practices every day, and I got to make lots of fun memories with them as well.\nHere’s where my hometown is on a map:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Plant Collection\n\n\nI’ve always loved having and taking care of plants, so while growing up, I had lots of plants in my room and the rest of my parents’ house. Now that I live in Isla Vista, I have very limited space for plants. Additionally, my apartment only has aast facing windows, which provide a lovely view of the apartment building right next to mine. So, my roommates and I unfortunately struggle to keep our plants that require more light alive.\nHowever, I currently own four plants in my apartment. A joshua tree that I started growing from seed around a year ago, a cactus that came with a Santa hat and googly eyes, and a Thai basil plant and seacliff buckwheat that I recently bought at UCSB’s greenhouse plant sale.\n\n  \n\nAs you can see, my joshua tree’s leaves are shriveling up so it doesn’t seem to be doing too well, and I think it’s because it needs more sun than it can get in my east facing window. Also, the googly eyes have fallen off of my cactus.\n\n\n\nMy Hobbies\n\n\nOne of my main hobbies is reading, and I do it as much as possible. I listen to audiobooks while I run, clean, cook, and walk to class, and I also read before I sleep most nights. The books that I read I borrow on Libby using my Orange County library card, which I have because my mom moved to Orange County when I moved for college.\nAnother big hobby of mine is running. As I said earlier, I ran cross country while I was in high school, and since then I’ve continued running regularly. I am part of UCSB’s run club, through which I have met some close friends, and I have also participated in the Ventura and Santa Barbara half marathons during my time in college. Hopefully, I will run the 2026 Ventura marathon.\nLots of my other hobbies revolve around nature. I love gardening, which I currently partake in just through taking care of my four plants, but I also love hiking, camping, and going tidepooling. On my most recent camping trip, myself and some friends camped at a state park in San Luis Obispo, and we went on a beautiful ten mile hike."

    "text": "Pickleweed Project\n\n\nSince fall quarter of my 2nd year in college, I’ve been working on a research project with the DECOMP Lab in the Department of Geography here at UCSB. I initially joined the project as a research assistant for Germán Silva, who started the pickleweed project to determine how changes in soil salinity impact the anthocyanin concentration of pickleweed, which is a plant that is native to wetlands in California. About a year into the project, I was offered the chance to start my own project related to Germán’s, so I decided to study how changes in soil salinity impact the chlorophyll content of pickleweed.\nGermán and I got to collect pickleweed seeds in UCSB’s North Campus Open Space, and then we planted them in pans and then repotted them in individual pots after they germinated. We had a little bit over 180 pickleweed plants, each in their own pot, which we kept in one of UCSB’s greenhouses. For a while after being repotted, we watered them with deionized water. Once they got adjusted to their new pots and had grown some more, we started watering them with three different salinity treatments: a control, low, and high.\nWe let the pickleweed grow in the greenhouse for about a year and then harvested all of them and extracted the chlorophyll from each. To determine the chlorophyll content, we put the extracts in a spectrophotometer, which read the absorbance of the extracts at three different wavelengths. Using the absorbance values, we could then calculate the chlorophyll concentration.\nThrough this project, I’ve gotten to learn a lot about the research process and build many skills. I’ve written grant proposals, presented my poster at a conference and multiple research symposiums, and I’ve also started learning how to code in RStudio so that I could analyze my data more efficiently. Futhermore, being part of the lab for so long has given me the opportunity to form close relationships with my PI, Jennifer King, my graduate advisor, Germán Silva, and the other lab members. I’m so glad that I decided to apply for the research assistant position two years ago because it has been an amazing professional development opportunity that has shaped my UCSB experience, and I’ve also formed so many fun memories with my lab mates that I’ll always cherish.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{kolb2025,\n  author = {Kolb, Kathryn},\n  title = {Research {Project}},\n  date = {2025-06-02},\n  url = {https://kathrynk04.github.io/posts/2025-06-02-research-project/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nKolb, Kathryn. 2025. “Research Project.” June 2, 2025. https://kathrynk04.github.io/posts/2025-06-02-research-project/."
