Hi! I'm Kathryn Kolb and I'm a third year Environmental Studies and Physical Geography double major at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I have recently conducted a study on Pickleweed with the DECOMP Lab in the Geography department, and I am also the DECOMP Lab Manager. In my free time, I enjoy running, gardening, reading, camping, and hiking.
